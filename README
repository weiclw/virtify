How to run this tool?

1. Install UTM on your mac.

You can search and find a link to download and install the tool.
This is a wrapper of qemu with all the firmwares that we need
to run on a MAC. Specifically, we need the disk images:

/Applications/UTM.app/Contents/Resources/qemu/edk2-aarch64-code.fd
/Applications/UTM.app/Contents/Resources/qemu/edk2-arm-vars.fd

for ARM Macs. We may need similar firmware hard disks for Intel
based Macs as well.

2. Install qemu via brew.

Yes, UTM includes a runnable qemu. But UTM packages it differently
such that we cannot launch it directly. And therefore there is a
need to install qemu again.

3. Run this tool.

In root directory of the source code, use the command

go run main.go --help

to learn all possible options that you have, before actually
running one.
